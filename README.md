## Introduction

This Web Application powered by <b>Machine Learning</b> and deployed using <b>Streamlit</b> focusses on various works on the <b>wisconsin dataset</b> starting from data source, cleaning, EDA and finally to creating a classification model that classifies whether a cancer is <b>benign or malignant</b>. The <b>accuracy of the model</b> is also checked using various methods and plots.

## Libraries Used

<ul>
  <li>Plotly</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>Sklearn</li>
  <li>Streamlit</li>
